# Ziti Foundation Library

This is a library containing core infrastructure for Ziti.

This is a step towards open-sourcing the entire Ziti ecosystem. We're in the process of working through preparing to alter our internal build and testing systems to accomodate the migration to GitHub.

This is a work in progress.
